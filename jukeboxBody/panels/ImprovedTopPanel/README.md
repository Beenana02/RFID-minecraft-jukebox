# 8/7- New and imporved top panel V2. 
## Made the panels thinner to allow for less filament and less print time
There's a split version to allow for printing on smaller 3D printers and a whole version as well 

To glue the panels together: 
- Use some old PLA to weld them together from the underside
- Sanded and add clear dry super glue to the top
